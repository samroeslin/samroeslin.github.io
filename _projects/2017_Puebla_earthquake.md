On 19 September 2017, a magnitude Mw 7.1 earthquake struck the central part of Mexico. It originated in the Puebla region and affected the Puebla, Morelos and Mexico City area. In the urban area, 77 buildings partially or totally collapsed, and 8,000 buildings experienced different levels of damage.

At the end of October 2017, a reconnaissance team from New Zealand spent about a week in Mexico City.
