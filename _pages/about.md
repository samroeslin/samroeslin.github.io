Samuel Roeslin is currently working in the Risk Data Hub (RDH) team at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. His research focuses on disaster risk modelling and the analysis of disaster-related losses and damages, with a particular emphasis on Europe. The policy-driven nature of his work has led him to collaborate with several Directorates-General (DGs) within the European Commission, including the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) and the Directorate-General for Climate Action (DG CLIMA). He has also established partnerships with organizations such as the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), the European Central Bank (ECB), the World Bank, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), among others.

Samuel holds a PhD from the Auckland University (2022), a master’s degree from the Regensburg University of Applied Sciences (2016) and bachelor’s degrees from the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences (2014) and the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (2014) and a Professional bachelor's degree (Licence Professionnelle) from the Robert Schuman University Institute of Technology (2014).

Samuel has practical experience in post-disaster building damage assessment. In late October 2017, he joined a reconnaissance team on a mission to Mexico City to survey and document building damage, an effort critical to understanding how structures performed during seismic events.
